# lnkmx — The Business OS for the Solo-Economy

> **Strategic Vision:** lnkmx is transitioning from a simple "Link-in-bio" tool to a comprehensive **Business Operating System** (Solo OS) for creators and micro-businesses. Our goal is to consolidate the fragmented tech stack (Site Builder + CRM + Booking + Payments) into a single, mobile-first, AI-native platform.

---

## 1) What lnkmx is

**Positioning:** The Micro-Business Operating System — Page Builder + Mini-CRM + Analytics + Fintech Foundation.

lnkmx is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed for the **Solo-Economy (2026)**, where creators operate as independent digital enterprises. It combines:

1. **Page Builder** — AI-powered drag-and-drop constructor with 28+ blocks. Uses the **"Liquid Glass"** aesthetic (glassmorphism, premium micro-animations, and depth) to provide a high-end look by default.
2. **Mini-CRM** — Real-time lead management, automated Telegram notifications, and status tracking.
3. **Advanced Analytics** — Server-side tracking (Pixel Proxy) to bypass browser restrictions and provide 30% more accurate data for Ad spending optimization (CAPI).
4. **Team Collaboration** — RBAC-based organization management for multi-user page editing and roles.
5. **Fintech Core** — Integrated ledger for transaction tracking, multi-currency wallets, and future real-world payment gateway support (Kaspi/Robokassa).

**Core Value:** Eliminating the "Tool Tax" (high costs and admin fatigue from using multiple разрозненных SaaS) by providing a unified infrastructure in 15 minutes.

### Key Competitive Moats
- **Liquid Glass Aesthetic:** Premium design capital that allows users to charge more for their services.
- **AI-Native Workflow:** Gemini-powered content and layout generation to solve "blank page syndrome".
- **Data-Backed Retention:** High switching costs once customer data (leads/bookings) is stored in the lnkmx CRM.
- **Privacy-First Analytics:** Server-side proxying (FB CAPI, TikTok) for 2026's cookieless environment.

### Repository Security & Privacy
The codebase is hosted in a **Private** repository to protect intellectual property and business logic. Access is restricted to authorized team members and IPA BEEGIN representatives. Git history is periodically audited and sanitized of sensitive credentials. See [ADR 0024: Repository Security and Privacy](file:///c:/Users/admin/OneDrive - УО 'Алматы Менеджмент Университет'/Документы/inkmax/docs/ADR/0024-repository-security.md) for details on recent security hardening.

**Target audiences:**
- Experts and consultants showcasing services with booking and lead capture
- Small businesses managing products, clients, and analytics
- Service providers (beauty, fitness, education) with appointment scheduling
- Creators and freelancers needing a professional web presence

## 7) Public Pages and SEO

**Metadata API:**
Dynamic SEO meta tags are managed via `react-helmet-async` on the client and injected into the initial HTML by the `seo-ssr` edge function for crawlers.

**Structured data (JSON-LD):**
- WebPage schema for all pages
- Person/Organization for profiles
- FAQPage for FAQ blocks
- Event schema for event blocks
- LocalBusiness for service pages

**AEO/GEO optimization:**
- **Server-rendered HTML** for AI crawlers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini)
- Semantic HTML (h2/h3 structure)
- Key facts bullet points

**Technical SEO:**
- Sitemap: `src/app/sitemap.ts` (Dynamic generation)
- SEO Landing: `/seo-landing` for deep indexing of core platform value.
- Robots: `src/app/robots.ts`
- Canonical URLs per page

**Liquid Glass Design System** - A premium visual overhaul featuring:
  - **Glassmorphism**: Consistent use of `glass-card`, `backdrop-blur-xl`, and `border-white/10`.
  - **Depth & Shadows**: Layered shadows using `shadow-glass`, `shadow-glass-lg`, and `shadow-primary/20`.
  - **Premium Typography**: Extensive use of `text-gradient` for headers.
  - **Interactive Micro-animations**: Hover scales (`scale-[1.02]`), active presses (`scale-[0.98]`), and background glow transitions.
- **Motion system** (CSS + IntersectionObserver)
  - Staggered reveals and intersection-based transitions.
  - Performance-optimized CSS animations.

**Dashboard v2 (current):**

Located in `src/components/dashboard-v2/`:
- Layout components (header, sidebar, navigation)

## 12) Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Migration/Schema errors:**
- Check `supabase/migrations/` for pending migrations
- Run migrations via Lovable Cloud interface
- Verify RLS policies do not block expected operations

**Block save failures:**
- Check network tab for 400/500 errors on `/rest/v1/blocks`
- Verify `page_id` exists and user owns the page
- Check for duplicate block IDs (use `ensureBlockIds()`)

**Auth loops:**
- Clear localStorage (`sb-*` keys)
- Check `user_profiles` table has matching user record
- Verify Supabase auth settings (auto-confirm enabled)

**AI generation fails:**
- Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret is set
- Verify rate limits (3/week for free users)
- Check Edge Function logs for errors

**Event registration not working:**
- Verify `events` table has matching event_id
- Check `event_registrations` RLS allows public insert
- Verify email service (Resend) is configured

**QR scanner not working:**
- Requires HTTPS (not localhost)
- Check camera permissions
- Some devices require explicit hardware access grant

# Build/Lint errors:
- Run `npm run typecheck` to identify type issues
- Check for unused imports/variables
- Verify all block types are registered in `block-registry.ts`

**Git Push Errors:**
- **HTTP 408/Timeout:** Run `git config http.postBuffer 524288000` to increase buffer size.
- **GH001 Large Files:** Check if `.next` folder was committed. Remove it from git history and add to `.gitignore`.

## 13) Adding New Blocks Safely

1. Add the block type to domain types and block registry (`src/lib/block-registry.ts`).
2. Implement renderer (`src/components/blocks/`) and editor UI (`src/components/block-editors/`).
3. Add localization keys for labels and helper text.
4. Update free vs Pro gating rules if needed.
5. Add analytics tracking for clicks or form submits.
